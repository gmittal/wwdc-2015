# WWDC 2015
My application for the [WWDC](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/) 2015 Student Scholarship. The app was one of the 350 selected to receive full scholarships to Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference. A quick demo of my app is available at [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryTamhlDfEU).

__Note:__: Future applicants, never submit your application less than 5 minutes before the deadline. There's a lot that could go wrong during submission (a couple of my friends had to re-submit twice or thrice), and could mean the difference between receiving and not receiving the scholarship.
